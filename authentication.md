# âœ… Authentication

Only holders of at least one of my friend.tech shares can access the bot and Discord server, shares can be purchased here:

[https://www.friend.tech/rooms/0xa3859b61db90ce97368229cd9c16ea440b390116](https://www.friend.tech/rooms/0xa3859b61db90ce97368229cd9c16ea440b390116)

To authenticate your instance type your twitter display name (not your @) when prompted. Reminder that it is case sensitive. For example:

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (7).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

When prompted I would type > Thunderbiord

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Each user is allowed one instance, if you need to switch devices and would like me to reset your instance ask in the friend.tech chat.

Note:

If you are having troubles authenticating let me know in the Discord server or friend.tech chat and I will help you fix the issue. I will manually be adding people to the authenticated list so ask me if I have added you before trying to authenticate.&#x20;
