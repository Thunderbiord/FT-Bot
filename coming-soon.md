# ðŸ‘€ Coming Soon

friend.tech Bot current version: (1.1.0)

Features In Progress:

* Auto liquidate: Automatically sell shares of a given address if price falls X percent or below X price. Progress (0%): Potential feature I am looking at adding.
* Auto fill: Automatically buy shares of a given address if price falls X percent or below X price. Progress (0%): Potential feature I am looking at adding.

Note:&#x20;

Features listed under "Features In Progress" are features I am currently working on adding. There is no ETA on when they will be implemented. If I encounter issues with implementing the feature in a easy to use way or friend.tech changes their app making a feature obsolete it may never be added. I will update the feature progress if I encounter any issues or I am close to releasing a new feature.
