# ðŸ”« Share Sniper

The share sniper will monitor a specified share address and automatically buy after the first share has been purchased and sale is live. Below is a demonstration of using the share sniping feature:

First you will be prompted to enter the share address you would like to snipe:

Finally you will be prompted to enter the amount of eth to send per transaction. Be sure to read [important.md](../important.md "mention")to understand how transactions are routed and the amount in ETH you should send:

After this the share sniper will start monitoring the share address for the the first share to be purchased:

Note:

If the sale is already live the share sniper will close and ask you to use the share buyer instead. You can find friend.tech accounts before they go live by watching [monitors.md](../discord-private-public/monitors.md "mention") in the Discord server.
