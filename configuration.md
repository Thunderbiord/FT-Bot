Before you can properly use the bot you must configure your settings. After typing 1 to enter the settings menu you will be prompted to add a wallet, RPC, Basescan API key, and preset your buy and sell gas:

Option 1 will prompt you to enter your wallet private key. Your private key will be stored locally on your computer in the bot folder in a .txt file:

It is recommended that you use a burner wallet incase your pc were compromised.&#x20;

Option 2 will prompt you to enter your RPC HTTPS url. A list of RPC options can be found on the official base website here: [https://docs.base.org/tools/node-providers/](https://docs.base.org/tools/node-providers/). I personally use a  Chainstack RPC. Your RPC url will be stored locally on your computer in the bot folder in a .txt file:

Option 3 will prompt you to enter your Basescan API key. You can get your own Basescan API key by following the directions under the "Getting Started" section of the Basescan Docs here: [https://docs.basescan.org/getting-started/viewing-api-usage-statistics](https://docs.basescan.org/getting-started/viewing-api-usage-statistics). Your API key will be stored locally on your computer in the bot folder in a .txt file:

Option 4 will prompt you to enter the max gas fee in Gwei you would like to send for both your buy and sell transactions. Your max gas fee will be stored locally on your computer in the bot folder in a .txt file:

Note:

All of your settings are stored locally in the bot folder in separate .txt files. You can change your settings either through the menu again or by manually editing the .txt files. If you have any issues setting up the bot let me know in the Discord server or friend.tech chat and I will help you fix the issue.&#x20;
